Kicked off the Hard-drive into the world!

These are just bits of code that I created to fill a need for something that I couldn't find on the internet

python/mqtt <---- Right now this contains a bare bones no paho MQTT sender (low dependancy and lightweight) 

            This is based on the micropython implementation

python/timeflip <----- Very basis implementation to talk to the timeflip1 and make it into a hyperion remote
